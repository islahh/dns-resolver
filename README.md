# DNS Resolver from scratch

# What is DNS?

Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

## How Does DNS Work?

1. **Entering the Website Name:**

   - **Analogy:** You want to send a letter to your friend but only know their name, not their address.
   - You type a website name (like "example.com") into your browser.

2. **DNS Lookup:**

   - **Analogy:** The post office checks its directory to find your friend's address.
   - Your computer contacts a DNS server and asks for the IP address associated with "example.com".

3. **DNS Server Response:**

   - **Analogy:** The post office finds the address and gives it to you.
   - The DNS server finds the IP address for "example.com" and sends it back to your computer.

4. **Connecting to the Website:**
   - **Analogy:** Now that you have the address, you can send your letter.
   - Your computer uses the IP address to connect to the website's server and access its content.

## The Inner Workings of DNS

- **DNS Hierarchy and Structure:**
  - **Analogy:** Think of DNS as a tree with branches. At the top is the root domain, under which are top-level domains (TLDs) like .com, .net, .org. Under these are second-level domains, which are the names people can register (like "google" in "google.com").
- **Types of DNS Servers:**

  - **Root Name Servers:** Like an index in a library that directs you to different sections.
  - **TLD Name Servers:** Like a specific shelf in the library that holds books from one category.
  - **Authoritative Name Servers:** Like a specific book in the library that provides detailed information on a particular topic.

- **Caching:**

  - **Analogy:** Your browser remembers the address (IP) it found for a while.

- **DNS Resolution Process:**
  - **Recursive Resolver:** Your computer's first stop for DNS queries. Like asking a librarian to find a book for you.
  - **DNS Query Process:** The recursive resolver asks the root server, which directs it to the TLD server, which in turn points to the authoritative server for the final IP address.

# Learnings

## What is a packet?

A packet in network communication is a small segment of data sent over a digital network. When data is transmitted over the Internet, it is broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces known as packets. Each packet contains not only a portion of the data you're sending (like a piece of an email or a video stream) but also important information about the data.

### Components of a Packet:

1. **Header:** This part contains control information, such as:

   - Source and destination IP addresses (tells where the packet is coming from and where it's going).
   - Protocol type (like TCP or UDP).
   - Packet number (which helps in reassembling the packets in the correct order).

2. **Payload:** This is the actual data that the packet is transporting.

3. **Trailer:** This part contains error-checking and other data that ensures the integrity of the packet.

### Analogy

Imagine sending a long letter to a friend. Instead of sending the whole letter in one big envelope, you divide it into smaller parts, each with a note saying "Page 1 of 10", "Page 2 of 10", and so on. Each of these smaller parts is like a packet. When your friend receives them, they can use the information on each part to reassemble the entire letter in the correct order.

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**Analogy:** Think of UDP like sending a letter through regular mail. You write your message, put it in an envelope, and send it off. But, there's no guarantee that it will reach its destination, or in what condition it will arrive. There's no acknowledgment from the receiver, and you don't wait for a reply.

**Pros:**

- **Speed:** UDP is faster because it has minimal error-checking and no acknowledgment mechanism.
- **Efficiency:** It's useful for applications where speed and efficiency are more critical than accuracy.

**Cons:**

- **No Reliability:** Thereâ€™s no guarantee that the packets will reach their destination.
- **No Order Guarantee:** Packets can arrive out of order.

**Use Cases:**

- Live streaming
- Online gaming
- Voice or Video calls (where minor loss of data is acceptable for the sake of real-time communication)

### What is Datagram?

A datagram is a small packet of information sent over a network without confirmation of receipt. It's a concept used in UDP. You can think of it like a postcard sent without any guarantee of delivery - quick but not always reliable.

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**Analogy:** TCP is like sending a certified mail. When you send a letter, you get a receipt, and the recipient signs upon delivery. If something goes wrong, the postal service takes steps to correct it.

**Pros:**

- **Reliability:** Ensures data is delivered accurately and in order.
- **Error Checking:** If a packet is lost, TCP retransmits it.

**Cons:**

- **Slower:** This reliability and error-checking come at the cost of speed.
- **More Overhead:** Requires more resources to maintain the connection state and check data integrity.

**Use Cases:**

- Web browsing
- Email
- File transfers

## Comparison between UDP and TCP

| Feature     | UDP                            | TCP                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Reliability | Low (No guarantee of delivery) | High (Guaranteed delivery)    |
| Speed       | High                           | Lower due to error correction |
| Ordering    | No guarantee                   | Maintains order               |
| Use Case    | Streaming, Gaming              | Web browsing, Email           |
| Overhead    | Low                            | High                          |

- **Connection:** TCP is connection-oriented. UDP is connectionless.
- **Reliability:** TCP is reliable. UDP is not.
- **Order and Integrity:** TCP maintains order and integrity of data. UDP does not.
- **Speed:** TCP is slower due to its reliability mechanisms. UDP is faster but less reliable.

## Why UDP for DNS Resolver and not TCP?

- UDP is faster than TCP. It doesn't establish a connection before sending data, and it doesn't wait for acknowledgment.
- DNS queries are usually small.
- UDP is connectionless, so it doesn't require the overhead of end-to-end connection.
- If a response is not received within a timeframe, the client can retransmit the request.

## DNS Message Format

DNS messages are used for querying DNS servers to translate domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) and vice versa. A DNS message has several components:

### 1. Header

- **Identification:** A unique ID for the DNS request. It's like a tracking number for your query.
- **Flags:** These indicate the type of query, whether it's a standard query, a response, or an error message. They also include other settings.
- **Question Count:** The number of questions in the DNS request.
- **Answer Count:** The number of answers in the DNS response.
- **Authority Count:** The number of authority records (provides information about DNS servers authoritative for a zone).
- **Additional Count:** The number of additional records.

### 2. Question Section

- **Name:** The domain name you're querying about, like `www.example.com`.
- **Type:** The type of query (e.g., A for IP address, MX for mail exchange server).
- **Class:** This is usually IN (Internet), indicating it's an Internet query.

### 3. Answer Section

- **Name:** The domain name the answer is referring to.
- **Type:** The type of the answer record (e.g., A, MX).
- **Class:** Similar to the question section, usually IN.
- **TTL (Time to Live):** How long the answer can be cached before a new request should be made.
- **Data Length:** The length of the answer data.
- **Data:** The actual data, like the IP address for the domain.

### 4. Authority Section

- Contains authoritative name server records. It tells you which DNS server has the authoritative (final) answer to your query.

### 5. Additional Section

- Contains additional information, like alternative servers or services related to the query.

### How Does It Work?

1. **You ask:** "What's the IP address for `www.example.com`?"
2. **DNS Query is Sent:** Your computer sends a DNS query with this question.
3. **DNS Response:** A DNS server responds with an answer, like "The IP address for `www.example.com` is 192.0.2.1".

## The "Recursion Desired" Flag

In the DNS header, the "Recursion Desired" flag, when set to 1, tells the DNS server that it should perform a recursive query if it doesn't have the answer. A recursive query means the DNS server will query other servers on your behalf until it finds the answer, rather than just referring you to another server. Setting this flag is common for most client-side DNS requests, as it simplifies the client's job.

## Big Endian

"Endian" refers to the order in which bytes are arranged and interpreted in computer memory. It's about which end (big or little) of a data word is stored in the lowest memory address.

Think of big endian as writing a date in the format Year-Month-Day. No matter where you start reading (from the left), you get the most significant part first (the year).

The "lower address" in memory is like the beginning of a line. In big endian, you start with the most significant part of your data at this beginning.

**Big Endian:** The most significant byte (the "big end") of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address. For example, for the number 0x1234, 0x12 is stored first.

**Why Big Endian for DNS:** DNS protocol, as defined in RFC 1035, specifies the use of big endian (also known as network byte order) for transmitting numbers. This is important for interoperability, ensuring that all systems talking DNS protocol interpret multi-byte numbers in the same way, regardless of their native byte order.

## Why Buffer.from()?

Using `Buffer.from` is crucial in the `encodeDomainName` function for accurately representing the length of each domain label as a byte, rather than a simple number.

- **Byte Representation:** `Buffer.from([part.length])` creates a buffer containing exactly one byte representing the length of the label. This is a binary representation, not just a numeric value.
- **DNS Protocol Requirement:** The DNS protocol requires the length of each label to be in the binary format, as part of the query message. Simply using `part.length` would insert a numeric value, which would not conform to the protocol's requirements.
- **Examples of What Could Go Wrong:**
  - If you use `part.length` directly, it would be treated as a character in the string, which could lead to incorrect domain name encoding. For example, a label length of 3 would be added as the character '3', not as the binary value 0x03.
  - This misrepresentation would lead the DNS server to interpret the query incorrectly, potentially failing to resolve the domain name or returning an erroneous response.

## Buffer

A Buffer in Node.js is a simple way to handle raw binary data. Think of it as a sequence of bytes, much like an array, but with a fixed size and specifically designed for binary data.

### What is a Buffer?

- **Fixed-size Chunk of Memory:** A Buffer is essentially a block of memory outside the V8 JavaScript engine's heap. This memory block can store a fixed amount of data in a binary format.
- **Array of Bytes:** You can think of a Buffer as an array where each element is a byte (8 bits). Unlike JavaScript arrays, which can store different types of elements, a Buffer is dedicated to bytes only.
- **Handles Binary Data:** Buffers are particularly useful when you need to work with binary data, like reading files from a disk, interacting with streams, or dealing with network communications.
- **Encoding/Decoding Data:** A Buffer can represent data in various encodings (like UTF-8, ASCII, or Base64) and is capable of converting data to and from these formats.

## Single Byte

A "single byte" means a unit of digital information composed of 8 bits.

- The length of each domain label (like 'www' or 'google') is converted into a binary format that occupies exactly 8 bits.
- For instance, if a label is 'www', its length is 3. The binary representation of 3 is `00000011`, which is a single byte.
- This byte is used in the DNS query to tell the server how many characters the following label has.

## `encodeDomainName('www.youtube.com')` -> `<Buffer 03 77 77 77 07 79 6f 75 74 75 62 65 03 63 6f 6d 00>`

- `03` - The length of the first label "www" (3 characters).
- `77 77 77` - The ASCII values for the characters 'w', 'w', 'w'.
- `07` - The length of the second label "youtube" (7 characters).
- `79 6f 75 74 75 62 65` - The ASCII values for 'y', 'o', 'u', 't', 'u', 'b', 'e'.
- `03` - The length of the third label "com" (3 characters).
- `63 6f 6d` - The ASCII values for 'c', 'o', 'm'.
- `00` - A null byte indicating the end of the domain name.
